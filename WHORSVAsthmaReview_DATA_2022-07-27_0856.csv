The Cox models were stratified for year of birth and, where  possible, for month of birth. The statistical model of the  association between asthma and palivizumab exposure was also tested with gestational age and birth weight as continuous  factors. Each outcome disease was analyzed independently  of the other two. Children were followed from date of birth to date of first outcome and censored at death, emigration, exposure to motavizumab, or end of study, whichever came first. For the analyses of the outcome measures defined by the algorithms (based on ICD-10 and ATC codes) follow-up was stopped 1 year earlier (31  December 2009 in Denmark and 31 December 2010 in Sweden) because the drug criteria in the algorithms to define atopic dermatitis and asthma required 1 extra year of data collection to define the outcomes measures. Age in days was used as the underlying time in the Cox  models. Palivizumab exposure was treated as a time-dependent variable changing value from unexposed to exposed at age of first palivizumab exposure, so exposed children were included and first followed as unexposed and then followed as exposed. Missing values were handled by adding a 'missing values' category, and the effect of excluding variables with  missing values from the statistical model was tested.  To address potential confounding by indication in the  association between palivizumab exposure and asthma, two additional post hoc analyses were carried out in the cohorts of premature children, as follows: Matching on frailty index: Children exposed to palivizumab were matched with control children without palivizumab exposure on history of frailty, defined by accumulated number of prior hospitalizations due to severe infection or accumulated number of days in hospital (see ESM 'A'). Furthermore, we conducted a weighted Cox regression  analysis using propensity scores (PS) for having received  palivizumab before 24 months of age (the model is described in detail in ESM 'A').

This was done for each combination of congenital heart disease (yes/no) and country (Denmark/Sweden), which means that four logistic regression models where performed. This implies that the effect of the covariates was allowed to vary for each of these four combinations.  Palivizumab treated children were given a weight of one (1) while weights for non-palivizumab children were calculated as the ratio of the estimated PS to one minus the estimated PS.

This outcome was analyzed separately for the first 1, 2, and 3 years after the child's hospitalization for bronchiolitis.    Data on asthma medications of the children were derived from the Social Insurance Institution that is the sole authority in Finland to keep a register of all sales and reimbursements of prescription medications on an individual level. The Social Insurance Institution supplies reimbursement for asthma medications if certain diagnostic criteria are fulfilled.  An essential requirement for granting reimbursement for asthma medications to a child was a medical certificate issued by a physician verifying the presence of recurrent wheezing (>=3 medically attended wheezing episodes) or the diagnosis of asthma.  A further  requirement was a long-term need for asthma controllers (e.g. corticosteroids); temporary 'as-needed' use of bronchodilators alone was not sufficient for granting reimbursement.
